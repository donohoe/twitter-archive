# Hello

I am dashing off to Thanksgiving events so...

Download your Twitter Archive
Drop it into teh same folder as teh PHP file
Run the PHP script... (thats a process!)
Manually copy over the 'tweets_media' foler from archive to the 'public' directory. (broken)
Delete 'build-public-archive.php'
Everything in 'public' directory should be good to go/host.

More details and additions to come.

Sorry about teh code. Really sorry. Rushed it.


## Known Issues

Forgot to copy over icon fonts as part of it.
Terrible instructions.
