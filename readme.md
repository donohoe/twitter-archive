# Hello

I am dashing off to Thanksgiving events so...

- Download your Twitter Archive
- Drop it into teh same folder as teh PHP file
- Run the PHP script... (thats a process!)
- Manually copy over the 'tweets_media' foler from archive to the 'public' directory. (broken)
- Delete 'build-public-archive.php'
- Everything in 'public' directory should be good to go/host.

More details and additions to come.

Sorry about teh code. Really sorry. Rushed it.


## Known Issues

- Forgot to copy over icon fonts as part of it.
- Terrible instructions.
- Only supports 1 image or video in tweets.

## Future Changes

- Links to individiual tweets
- Search
- Non-PHP versions of build script (no reason it must be PHP)
- More tweet formats
